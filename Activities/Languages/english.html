           <h1>Overcoming language obstacles</h1>

    <p>Asylum seekers arriving in Hong Kong are from varous background and various social 
status. Some of them are well educated with fluency in English whiles others speak no other
language than their mother tongue.</p>
<p>Face to that environment, some NGO took a step to help asylum seekers and refugees 
to learn English as it is useful not only to communicate about their cases but also to express
their feeling.</p>
<p> When the course ends students receive certificates for their knowledge of the language.</p>
