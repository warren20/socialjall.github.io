<div style="background-color:grey"
<p> I First downloaded the road and after I downloaded every car. I created different layers in photoshop. Usind different tools like brushes, polygonal lasso tool, move tool, eraser, free transform..., I managed to do everything necessary to put both cars in the road. NB: I was unable to save online a picture that when opened can show all layers.</p> </div>
