<div style="background-color:yellow">
<p>First, I downloaded the road and secondary  I downloaded every car. I created different layers in photoshop. Using different tools like brushes, polygonal lasso tool, move tool, eraser, free transform..., Finally, I managed to do everything necessary to put both cars in the road. NB: I was unable to save online a picture which,  when opened can show all layers. but I saved a file in "psd" format on my computer.</p> </div>
